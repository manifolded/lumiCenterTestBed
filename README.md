# lumiCenterTestBed

Testing the lumiCenter calcs

lumiCenter refers to a class that calculates the COM of the luminosity in the image.  This was a primitive precursor to the app I actually want to build.

This is a project based on the Android CameraX library.  It died on the vine when it became clear that CameraX didn't allow (as of April 2020) the developer access to the camera's raw data.

The project continues, now using the much older Camera2 interface.  See the repo sensible-detachment.
